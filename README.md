The app automatically detects the type of content (e.g., "Development", "Infrastructure", "Design") and assigns custom 3D icons and color themes dynamically.

### 2. EFM & Control Filtering
Intelligent filtering logic separates course materials into **Lessons**, **Controls** (Continuous Assessment), and **EFMs** (Final Exams) tabs automatically based on file naming conventions.
